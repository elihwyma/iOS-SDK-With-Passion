# iOS SDK With Passion

iOS SDKs with headers for the PrivateFrameworks that I use 

iPhoneOS14.4-Xcode is a SDK that sits inside Xcode 12.4 instead of inside Theos. It has NearField, IOKit and OnBoardingKit

Since this Git repo is rather large, each SDK has an accompanying .zip to allow partial downloading

The Beta directory is for messing around during development, so disregard it for actual use
